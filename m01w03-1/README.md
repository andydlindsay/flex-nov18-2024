# M01W03 - TDD, CommonJS, and NPM

### To Do
- [x] Manual testing
- [x] Making assertions
- [x] Bringing in outside code
- [x] Exporting our code
- [x] Intro to NPM: a Node package manager
- [x] Mocha test runner
- [x] Ignoring files/folders
- [x] What is TDD?
- [x] Practice unit testing

### Manual Testing

### Assertions
* a forceful statement of fact or belief
* assert forcefully that actual is equal to expected

### Node
* C++ app
* JS interpreter
* Chrome V8 engine
* wrapped it in C++
* modules that help us perform backend tasks

C code => compile .exe => run .exe

### NPM
* Node Package Manager
* package is code that we didn't write
* npmjs.com

```bash
npm install package-name # saves it as a dependency of our project
npm install --save-dev package-name # saves it as a development dependency
npm install --global package-name # saves it globally on your OS
```

### TDD
* Test-Driven Development
* write the tests before the code

### Unit Testing
* testing the smallest pieces of your code (function)
